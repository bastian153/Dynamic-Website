            <p>
            Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John
            Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, Harry Potter and the Cursed 
            Child is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first 
            official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play will 
            receive its world premiere in London's West End on July 30, 2016.

            It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier 
            now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a 
            husband and father of three school-age children.
            </p>
            <p>
            While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it 
            belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a 
            family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, 
            both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, 
            darkness comes from unexpected places.
