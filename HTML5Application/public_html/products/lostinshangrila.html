            "A lost world, man-eating tribesmen, lush andimpenetrable jungles, 
            stranded American fliers (one of them a dame withgreat gams, for 
            heaven's sake), a startling rescue mission. . . . This is a true 
            story made in heaven for a writer as talented as Mitchell Zuckoff. 
            Whewâ€”what an utterly compelling and deeplysatisfying read!"

            Award-winning former Boston Globe reporter Mitchell Zuckoff 
            unleashes the exhilarating, untold story of an extraordinary 
            World War II rescue mission, where a plane crash in the South Pacific
            plunged a trio of U.S.military personnel into a land that time 
            forgot. Fans of Hampton Sides' Ghost Soldiers, Marcus Luttrell's Lone
            Survivor, and David Grann's The Lost City of Z will be captivated by 
            Zuckoff's masterfully recounted, all-true story of danger, daring, 
            determination, and discovery in jungle-clad New Guinea during the 
            final days of WWII.
